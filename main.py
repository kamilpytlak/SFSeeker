Sci-Fi Stack Exchange Seeker (aka SF Seeker) is an AI assistant that helps you write better questions and search for
semantically similar questions on Sci-Fi Stack Exchange (https://scifi.stackexchange.com/). An all-MiniLM-L6-v2
language model (transformer) was used.

**Features**
- üîé Based on a database of 71,013 questions, it searches for the most semantically similar questions to the one entered
by the user. This supports the process of fiding the same/similar questions already asked and prevents the creation of
duplicate threads.
- üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è [IN PROGRESS] Indicates words in a question that have a negative and positive effect on the chance of
getting an answer. It supports the process of arranging more precise questions. A model based on gradient
reinforcement learned using TF-IDF features was used.
